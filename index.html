    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I am a returning student to El Camino after taking a 7 year break and I am currently pursuing my 
        Associates Degree in CIS and working on my prereqs to join the RadTech Program. 
        I have 9 cats who drive my life insane but there is no love like pet love. 
        I love watching movies and is a huge LOTDR fan. I have haved all the hobbit 
        and the extended version of Lord of the Rings a million times. Another movie I absolutley love
        Is the Jim Carrey film "THE MASK" who's lines I know  by heart. I like to go to the gym and

        Germantown (Maryland).</p>
